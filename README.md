# Nixie Clock
This repository contains the KiCAD files for the PCB and the Atmel Studio files for the code.

If you plan on recreating this, I recommend changing the PCB design to use all SMD components and paying attention to high voltage clearance.

[Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/SMD-Nixie-Clock/) write up for this project.

Uses the following libraries:
- Zak Kemble's [millis](https://github.com/zkemble/millis) library
- akafugu's [DS3231](https://github.com/akafugu/ds_rtc_lib) RTC library
